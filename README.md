## Path Finding Visualiser
Path Finding Visualiser is a tool that allows users to visualise various pathfinding algorithms in action.

### Features:
Path Finding Visualiser currently supports the following pathfinding algorithms:

1. A* algorithm 
2. Dijkstra algorithm 
3. Depth first search algorithm
4. Breath first search algorithm

### Basic Commands:
###### Mouse: 
-   Left mouse button: set a node  
-   Right mouse button: erase a node
###### Keyboard: 
-   Space: Start the game 
-   R: Restart the game
-   1: Choose A* algorithm 
-   2: Choose Dijkstra algorithm 
-   3: Choose Depth first search algorithm
-   4: Choose Breath first search algorithm
  
### How to play? 
1. Choose a start point: Click the left button to select a starting point on the grid
2. Choose an end point: Click the left button again to select an end point on the grid
3. Create barriers: To create barriers, either click or drag the left button on the grid
4. Choose an algorithm: Press 1, 2, 3, or 4 to select an algorithm for the pathfinding process
5. Start game: Press space bar to start visualising the path from start to end
